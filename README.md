# Customer Account Banking Management System

This project is a console-based application developed in C programming language, serving as a "Customer Account Banking Management System." It enables users to perform diverse banking operations efficiently. The application was collaboratively created by me and my project partner, Abhishek Patil, during our second year of diploma in Computer Science at Government Polytechnic Khamgaon. The application provides the following functions:

- **Menu**: Users are prompted to enter a password (password: "dsuproject") for login authentication before accessing the banking functionalities.

- **New Account**: Users can create new bank accounts by providing essential details such as name, address, phone number, account type, and initial deposit amount.

- **Modify Account**: Existing account holders can modify their account information, such as name or address.

- **Transaction**: Account holders can perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals to manage their account balance.

- **Delete Account**: The system allows users to close an existing account if needed.

- **List**: Users can view a list of all customer accounts with their respective details, including account number, name, bank balance, and account type.

- **Search**: Account details can be searched and displayed based on the account number.
